# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 Race Prediction and Driver Performance Analysis

This project explores predictive modeling and performance analysis in Formula 1 using historical race data. Leveraging Python and machine learning, we aim to:

- Predict driver rankings in upcoming races
- Analyze season-over-season performance shifts
- Visualize clusters of improving or declining drivers

## Project Structure
- `F1prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full pipeline
- `datasets/`: Raw data files used for analysis

## Key Techniques
- Regression (Random Forest, XGBoost) for rank prediction
- KMeans clustering for performance trends
- PCA/t-SNE for cluster visualization
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and result evaluation using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
